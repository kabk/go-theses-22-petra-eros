      <h2>abstract</h2>
      <p class="text-justify">Neoliberalism, the socio-economic model of the present constitutes unsustainable standards of cognitive work. Precarization is spreading and the way we labor is demanding ever more flexibility and adaptability to be fit
        in the game of free-market economy. Foucauldian biopower transcended the physicality of the ‘docile bodies’ when production labor was superseded by cognitive capitalism.<span class="italics"> ‘We [no longer] deem ourselves subjugated subjects, but rather projects:
        always refashioning and reinventing ourselves.’<sup><a href="#fn:0" rel="footnote"></a></sup></span>– writes Byung Chul Han in Psychopolitics. Liberation from external domination and the elimination of master figures produces the illusion of freedom, but in reality, new instrumental tools of
        power colonised the psyche. Now we are all carrying an internal labor camp within ourselves, wherein master and slave are fully integrated and <span class="italics">Arbeit macht night frei – Labour does not set (us) free – </span>but brings forth the totalisation of
        labor, generating psychopathologies such as burn out syndrome, attention deficiency, and depression.
        Therefore we have entered the era of neuropolitics, which is a novel technology of governing that invades the synaptic network of the brain. It is dominated by the discourse on neuroplasticity, the capacity that allow the brain to mold,
        (re)generate, and adapt itself structurally in its functioning. Claiming the brain as a highly under-utilized organ and describing its cognitive potentiality as limitless. 
        I am to investigate how the ingestion of neurochemicals can account for the stability of the neoliberal working conditions and the optional functioning of those with a neurochemical deficiency, a condition that results from the imperative to
        achieve without limits.

      <h2>introduction</h2>
      <blockquote>“Myth does not deny thing, on the contrary, its function is to talk about them; simply, it purifies them, it makes them innocent, it gives them a natural and eternal justification, it gives them a clarity which is not that of an
        explanation but of a statement of fact.”
        ― Roland Barthes, Mythologies <sup><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></blockquote>
      <div class="text-indent">
        <p>In Mythologies, Roland Barthes is analyzing how specific cultural objects have become the carrier of social value systems of modern society. He developed his notion of ‘myths’ relying on semiotics, the study of signs, inventing a model
          that constructs these modern myths.
          The model distinguishes two levels of signification: on the first level, we find the “language-object” operating, and beyond there is a second-order “metalanguage”, transmitting the myth.
          <div class="text-indent"><p>In the era of neuropolitics, psychopharmaceuticals are signifying the emergence of the neuronal subject. This new mode of thought implies that ‘optimal’ cerebral functioning is indispensable in relation to performing under neoliberal pressures of productivity and constant adaptability. On the meta-level, the ‘neuronal form of political and social functioning’ 0 signifies the ongoing normalization of routine modulation and enhancement of mental functions by neurochemical control, employed to harness market value.
  <div class="text-indent"><p>How and when does the brain become the target of governing? What socio-political and economic conditions are playing a crucial role in this neuronal transformation? Perhaps, the most urgent question at stake is: what does the future hold for us when novel kinds of 'cerebral knowledge' and technologies are imposing new ways of being governed and how we govern ourselves?
  In the following, I am to investigate all of the above mentioned, departing from the underlying historical context that serves as the foundation of my hypothesis – the birth of biopower, a term originally coined by Michel Foucault in 1977.
