        <p>Neoliberalism, the socio-economic model of the present constitutes unsustainable standards of cognitive work. Precarization is spreading and the way we work is demanding ever more flexibility and adaptability to be fit
          in the game of free-market economy. Foucauldian biopower transcended the physicality of the ‘docile body’ when production labor was superseded by cognitive capitalism.<span class="italics"> ‘We [no longer] deem ourselves subjugated
            subjects, but rather projects:
            always refashioning and reinventing ourselves.’<sup><a href="#fn:0" rel="footnote"></a></sup></span>– writes Byung Chul Han in Psychopolitics. Liberation from external domination and the elimination of master figures produces the illusion
          of freedom, but in reality, new instrumental tools of
          power colonised the psyche. Now we are all carrying an internal labor camp within ourselves, wherein master and slave are fully integrated and <span class="italics">Arbeit macht night frei – Labour does not set (us) free – </span>but brings
          forth the totalisation of
          labor, generating psychopathologies such as burn out syndrome, attention deficiency, and depression.
          Therefore we have entered the era of neuropolitics, which is a novel technology of governing that invades the synaptic network of the brain. It is dominated by the discourse on neuroplasticity, the capacity that allow the brain to mold,
          (re)generate, and adapt itself structurally in its functioning. Claiming the brain as a highly under-utilized organ and describing its cognitive potentiality as limitless. 
          I will investigate how the ingestion of neurochemicals can account for the stability of the neoliberal working conditions and the optional functioning of those with a neurochemical deficiency, a condition that results from the imperative
          to
          achieve without limits.

      <blockquote>Myth does not deny thing, on the contrary, its function is to talk about them; simply, it purifies them, it makes them innocent, it gives them a natural and eternal justification, it gives them a clarity which is not that of an
        explanation but of a statement of fact.

      <div class="text-indent">
        <p>In Mythologies, Roland Barthes is analyzing how specific cultural objects have become the carrier of social value systems of modern society. He developed his notion of ‘myths’ relying on semiotics, the study of signs, inventing a model
          that constructs these modern myths.
          The model distinguishes two levels of signification: on the first level, we find the “language-object” operating, and beyond there is a second-order “metalanguage”, transmitting the myth.
        <div class="text-indent">
          <p>In the era of neuropolitics, psychopharmaceuticals are signifying the emergence of the neuronal subject. This new mode of thought implies that ‘optimal’ cerebral functioning is indispensable in relation to performing under neoliberal
            pressures of productivity and constant adaptability. On the meta-level, the ‘neuronal form of political and social functioning’ signifies the ongoing normalization of routine modulation and enhancement of mental functions by neurochemical
            control, employed to harness market value.<sup><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote"></a></sup>

            <p>How and when does the brain become the target of governing? What socio-political and economic conditions are playing a crucial role in this neuronal transformation? Perhaps, the most urgent question at stake is: what does the future
              hold for us when novel kinds of 'cerebral knowledge' and technologies are imposing new ways of being governed and how we govern ourselves?
              In the following, I am to investigate all of the above mentioned, departing from the underlying historical context that serves as the foundation of my hypothesis – the birth of biopower, a term originally coined by Michel Foucault in
              1977.

      <div class="text-indent">
        <p>The advent of the steam machine – invented in 1764 by James Watt – triggered the Industrial Revolution. A manifold of industrial machinery started to appear in production, aiding the factory worker. This phenomenon fundamentally altered
          the structure of society, igniting the transformation of an agricultural to an industrial one. The birth of a new economic formulation, capitalism is to be dated roughly the same time. Simultaneously, ‘the West has undergone a very profound
          transformation of [the] mechanics of power’ - writes Michel Foucault in The History of Sexuality.<sup><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote"></a></sup> </p>
        <div class="text-indent">
          <p>Preceding the Industrial Revolution, the sovereign exercised absolute power over its subjects. This power of the sovereign was operating on the framework of necropolitics, a term coined by Achille Mbembe, where the practice of torture
            and execution was serving as a public spectacle. Foucault claims – it operates mainly by means of deduction and is characterized by the right of death and power over life.<sup><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote"></a></sup></p>
          <figure class="mx-auto">
            <img class="mx-auto d-block" src="https://d2w9rnfcy7mm78.cloudfront.net/15057692/original_36551d6c6c75dc62aa27472179c4ddcf.jpg?1644237968?bc=0">
            <figcaption>Guillotine is a necropolitical apparatus designed for efficiently carrying out executions by beheading. It is best known for its use in France, particularly during the French Revolution.</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <div class="text-indent">
            <p>Nevertheless, necropolitics was not a sustainable form of subjectivation in terms of the capitalist economic model. The severe mutilation of bodies as a form of penalty disables and hinders the human subject from working, thus,
              becoming impotent for value creation. Sovereign power needed a shift towards promoting the wellbeing of its subjects, by ‘making them grow, and ordering them, rather than one dedicated to impeding them, making them submit, or destroying
              them’ <sup><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote"></a></sup>. This marks the origin of biopolitics, an imperative feature of capitalism, which ‘would not have been possible without the controlled insertion of bodies into the machinery of
              production and the adjustment of the phenomena of population to economic processes.’ <sup><a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote"></a></sup>
            </p>
            <div class="text-indent">
              <p>The objective of biopolitics is stretching beyond the preservation of life, and it is exercising control on birth and mortality rates, life expectancy, or longevity. In fact, it is merely a single instrumental tool that asserts power
                within the framework of what Foucault calls, the disciplinary society. According to the French philosopher, governing industrialized societies are happening by the so-called disciplines: ’… in a system like this, we are never dealing
                with a mass...we are only ever dealing with individuals.’ <sup><a href="#fn:7" rel="footnote"></a></sup> </p>
              <div class="text-indent">
                <p>In sovereignty, each and everyone, as a collective social body is obliged both to author the power of the sovereign and obey the social contract at all times. Whereas, the disciplinary society fragments and redistributes power
                  through extensive surveillance on individual human activities. 
                  It brings about the establishment of asymmetric power relations between those who are being surveilled and the executioners of such surveillance. As a result, these particular mechanics enhance utilization as they reciprocate
                  increased docility.
                </p>
                <div class="text-indent">
                  <p>The distribution of power can only be operating efficiently as long there is a cellular division of space. The <span class="italics">art of distributions</span>, establishes individualism first by <span class="italics">an
                      enclosure</span> of a particular space through the construction of walls and gates, like in the case of factories or barracks. Beyond the walls of these spaces, further principles are operating to ensure maximum
                    control. Partitioning divides the given space into units, providing each individual with his designated place. </p>

                    to assess it, to judge it, to calculate its qualities or merits. It was a procedure, therefore, aimed at knowing, mastering and using. Discipline organizes an analytical space.’ <sup><a href="#fn:8" rel="footnote"></a></sup>

                      <p>The last aspect to touch upon is the establishment of a ranking system. Foucault provides us the example of the seating arrangement in the classroom, where pupils are distributed according to age, grade, and behavior. He
                        emphasizes, that this ranking system is never set in stone, but is fluidly altered after each examination. In the setting of the classroom or factory - where the level of productivity and output renders the ranking - such a
                        system constitutes not only docility but the willingness to excel, habituating an inner drive striving to produce more, give more, be more.

                              rel="footnote"></a></sup>Jeremy Bentham’s Panopticon is often regarded only as a highly effective model of a prison, with an omnipresent observer in a tower encircled with a peripheral building, divided into equal units

                          space for the observed.<sup><a href="#fn:10_1" rel="footnote"></a></sup> However, both Bentham and Foucault specifies that the blueprint of a Panopticon is rather an architectural framework, which can serve any institution.

                          While the physical element of visibility (of the observed) / invisibility (of the observer) produces biopower imposed on the bodies it encapsulates, it is also an attempt to obtain power over the mind. It activates a state
                          of alert consciousness (Am I being watched?), which ‘assures self-regulation of the observed, rendering the automatic functioning of power’. <sup><a href="#fn:10" rel="footnote"></a></sup>

                          <p>To finalize our depiction of disciplinary power, we have to look at the instrumental power of normativity. It is not enough to optimize, distribute and observe the objects, but it is crucial to demarcate boundaries
                            between standards of expected behavior and forms of divergence, which altogether gives form to a socially constructed system of norms. Accordingly, it is to be judged whether a type of behavior is normative or deviant,
                            which then brings about the righteousness of punitive action for the latter, and gives birth to a new discursive object: the figure of the abnormal. Throughout his body of work, Foucault introduces many faces of the
                            abnormal; the criminal, who trespasses the conduct of legal law, the sexually deviant, who defies heteronormativity, or the madmen, who present psychopathologic symptoms.

                            <p>We have seen how the absolute sovereign power, operated on deduction transformed into disciplinary power that targeted the body and maximized its functioning. Resulted by industrialization, human bodies were inserted
                              into the orchestrated mechanics of production, which required the accommodation of new, meticulous manners of motion and conduction of oneself. Nevertheless, these novel techniques could only achieve the subjugation of
                              bodies and not much of the mind. The architectural features of the Panopticon did attempt to penetrate the psyche, but the rhetorics of compulsion and prohibition fall short of achieving that. German philosopher,
                              Byung-Chul Han claims, that in the society of the 21st-century, the negativity of the disciplinarian modal verb Should is superseded by the positivity of Can.<sup><a href="#fn:11" rel="footnote"></a></sup>The wake of

        <p>The alienated worker is stripped from the autonomy of their own actions and is fully estranged from the ownership of value produced by their labor; therefore absolutely subjugated to those who own the means of production. Marx forecasted
          that such deprived human condition and the negative spiraling of surplus-value and labor cost will eventually result in the overthrow of capitalism by the revolution of the proletariat. On the contrary, production labor was instead
          substituted by the ever-increasing intellectual toil, and capitalism mutated into neoliberalism.
          Italian communist philosopher, Franco ‘Bifo’ Berardi in his paper Cognitarian Subjectivation, proclaims that the birth of cognitive capitalism roots in the refusal of alienation and exploitation, which instigates the necessity for
          developing innovative ways of production, fully replacing the worker with the machine. <sup><a href="#fn:13" rel="footnote"></a></sup>  As he writes:</p>
        <blockquote>... The intellectualization of human activity is – from any perspective – a consequence of the workers’ insubordination and resistance to exploitation … and this has provoked the enhancement of the sphere of intellectual labor and
          cognitive activity linked to value production.<sup><a href="#fn:14" rel="footnote"></a></sup></blockquote>
        <div class="text-indent">
          <p>Intellectual labor fundamentally alters the instruments of labor: it supersedes the material nature of machinery and tools – owned by the bourgeoise – by the immaterial cognitive force possessed by every individual. Shifting from
            corporeal to non-physical, the locus of power surpasses the limbs and colonizes the psychic force of men. ‘We [no longer] deem ourselves subjugated subjects, but rather projects: always refashioning and reinventing ourselves.’<sup><a
                href="#fn:15" rel="footnote"></a></sup> – writes Byung Chul Han in Psychopolitics. His philosophical work concerns the underlying precarious conditions of society encountered in the rapidly altering and technologically-driven
            post-Fordist state. He claims that subjectivation finds expression both in negative and positive forms – the latter is considered the main driving force in neoliberalism. The disciplinarian Should is as coercive as the unlimited Can,
            which produces the so-called achievement society that is governed through psychopolitics. </p>
          <div class="text-indent">
            <p>Referring back to the arts of distribution, the walls enclosing the Foucauldian subjects have perished and were replaced by innovative communal spaces advertised as delivering the perfect aesthetics and atmosphere for productive
              working. The reason why such a considerable amount of change took place lies in the inherent difference of the instrumental power psychopolitics applies to the working body. Although the substantial changes in the workspace stripped
              away the visible resemblance to the panoptic architecture, in the end, it reinforces a vast more efficient kind of subjectivation. Goals, projects, initiatives of the achievement-subject retrieved the alienation of labor and the ‘I is
              now subjugating itself to internal limitations and self-constrains, which are taking the form of compulsive achievement and optimization’ <sup><a href="#fn:16" rel="footnote"></a></sup>.
              As follows, Han unveils the genuine face of today's freedom, claiming that ‘in so far [the achievement-subject] willingly exploits itself without a master it is an absolute slave’ <sup><a href="#fn:17" rel="footnote"></a></sup>.
              Liberation from external domination eliminates master figures and constructs an internal labor camp within every individual. In this utter state of solitude, wherein master and slave are fully assimilated, <span class="italics">Arbeit

              <p>As cognitive capitalism altered the means of production, it also inherently eradicated the class struggle. ‘The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles’ – so begins the Communist Manifesto, the
                political pamphlet of Marx and Engels.<sup><a href="#fn:18" rel="footnote"></a></sup> They claim, that human societies have always been divided into oppressors and the oppressed, and eventually all these societies were overthrown by
                revolutionary reconstitutions to eliminate such differentiation. That comes from the potentiality that individuals who are suffering under the same conditions could join forces by the means of their shared antagonism. But how could
                the auto-exploiting achievement-subjects find any common denominator for political action, when the master is locked in their own minds?

                <p>Thus, the sense of belonging to a common ‘us’ is wearing thinner by the day, which greatly accounts for the stability of neoliberalism. Furthermore, it is crucial to touch upon another grounding pillar, that further deepens social
                  alienation; the omnipresence of precarity. While previously, precarization meant something foreign to the developed western society, occurring only in the far distances of the ‘Global South’, it relocated from the socio-economic

                  <p>Political theorist, Isabell Lorey in her book State of Insecurity, connects the notion of precarization with modern governmentality, arguing that the preferred way of governing today is realised ‘through regulating the minimum of
                    assurance, while simultaneously inscribing instability and social insecurity’ <sup><a href="#fn:19" rel="footnote"></a></sup>. Among others, she accounts precarity for the erosion of a possible collective organization, as it
                    facilitates the rise of short-term, flexible, and insecure employment conditions. She claims the precarious tend to be effectively isolated and individualized caused by the dispersion both in relation to production and the diverse
                    modes of production, thus rendering a neo-marxist revolution impossible. This is all due to the ‘neoliberal demolition and restructuring of collective security systems’, which is continuously enforcing increased pressure on the
                    neoliberal subject to self-govern.<sup><a href="#fn:20" rel="footnote"></a></sup>

        <p>Since the beginning of its existence, Homo Sapiens have always been inventing new technologies, that in return keep inventing a new type of human, being an active agent in shaping the perception of who we are and what makes us human. This
          type of power-knowledge is fully intertwined with the social, economic, and political terrains and continuously alters the particular ways of how we are being governed and how we govern ourselves too.
          Accelerating technological changes, that are originating from the arms and space race dominating the Cold War period, has led scientists to discover new ways of mapping the complexities of the human body. Refined digital image processing,
          which NASA developed for the Apollo Lunar Landing, later have found a broad array of other applications, especially in diagnostic purposes for medicine. As a result, machines like the MRI, CT, and PETScan have become one of the most
          powerful clinical tools that brought medicine to the modern era.
          Essentially, these machines enabled medical professionals to gaze at the human body through a radically new lens, and that is significantly altered how we see ourselves. Nicolas Rose in The Politics of Life itself claims, that we still tend
          to think of ourselves on a corporal, tangible, ‘molar’ level, however, contemporary biomedical practices are rather targeting us on a molecular level.<sup><a href="#fn:24" rel="footnote"></a></sup>
        </p>
        <blockquote>... life is now understood, and acted upon, at the molecular level, in terms of the functional properties of coding sequences of nucleotide bases and their variations, the molecular mechanisms that regulate expression and
          transcription, the link between the functional properties of proteins and their molecular topography, the formation of particular intracellular elements—ion channels, enzyme activities, transporter genes, membrane potentials—with their
          particular mechanical and biological properties.<sup><a href="#fn:25" rel="footnote"></a></sup></blockquote>

          <p>Like in the case of The Human Genome Project, which was an international effort to map out the human DNA in its full length, making it accessible for further biological studies, modern technologies of gene manipulation, such as CRISP-R
            emerged soon after, raising many ethical questions about its possible applications. A vast amount of neuro - and computer scientists today are working towards a new paradigm for understanding the brain, by decoding the structural
            wireframe of the human brain. The incentive of such a large-scale project is none other than ’to advance neuroscience and medicine and to create brain-inspired information technology’.<a href="#fn:26" rel="footnote"></a></sup>
            Therefore I claim, that the emergence of interest shown towards the brain and its functioning shapes how we regard ourselves and how our neural networks are being targeted by novel techniques of governing power.</p>
          <div class="text-indent">
            <p>The reason why neuropolitics surpasses the efficiency of psychopolitics is that the former offers both the continuation of subjectivation and the solution to minimize the collateral damage, that the latter has brought about.
              Furthermore, while biopower earlier could only impose its effects on bodies, and psychopower could only capture the psychic abilities, neuropolitics seeks to seize control both on the somatic and psychic level on its human subject.
              Aforementioned Nicolas Rose, who worked extensively on exploring the history and sociology of psychiatry and the social implications of recent developments in psychopharmacology, distinguishes several ‘pathways along which neuroscience
              becomes entangled with the government of the living’.<sup><a href="#fn:27" rel="footnote"></a></sup> In the following, I am to investigate how neuroplasticity and psychopharmacology embody ways of governing today.</p>
            <div class="text-indent">
              <p>The scientific discovery of brain plasticity or neuroplasticity hugely affected and fundamentally changed the way neuroscience, and later society and culture regarded the brain. The term ‘neuroplasticity’ was first coined by Jerzy
                Konorski, a polish neuroscientist in 1948, and is referring to the capacity allowing the brain to mold, (re)generate, and adapt itself structurally in its functioning. Preceding, in the work of Santiago Ramon y Cajal we can already
                find the hypothesis proposing the possibility of neuronal growth and altering in the adult brain. He writes in his anecdotal guide Advice for a Young investigator published in 1897 that ‘any man could, if he were so inclined, be the
                sculptor of his own brain’.<sup><a href="#fn:28" rel="footnote"></a></sup></p>
              <div class="text-indent">
                <p>Nevertheless, brain plasticity proves to only emerge and taken serious in the realm of modern neuroscience from the 1980s – claims Victoria Pitts-Taylor in her paper titled <span class="italics">The plastic brain</span>. She
                  introduces how plasticity refers to multiple processes of brain functioning, like the ability of neurogenesis (the production of new neurons ), synaptogenesis ( the establishment of new synaptic connections between neurons), and
                  synaptic modulation ( strengthening or weakening of the existing connections).<sup><a href="#fn:29" rel="footnote"></a></sup> Later, she outlines the problematics on neuroplasticity that is the subject matter of this paper:
                  plasticity is deployed to encourage us to see ourselves as neuronal subjects, … [that] firmly situates the subject in a normative, neoliberal ethic of personal self-care and responsibility linked to modifying the body.<sup><a
                      href="#fn:30" rel="footnote"></a></sup></p>
                <blockquote>[..] Plasticity directly contradicts rigidity. It is its exact antonym. In ordinary speech, it designates suppleness, a faculty for adaptation, the ability to evolve. According to its etymology - from the Greek plassein,
                  to mold - the word plasticity has two basic senses: it means at once the capacity to receive form (clay is called "plastic," for example) and the capacity to give form (as in the plastic arts or in plastic surgery) … But it must be
                  remarked that plasticity is also the capacity to annihilate the very form it is able to receive or create.
                  We should not forget that plastique, from which we get the words plastiquage and plastiquer, is an explosive substance made of nitroglycerine and nitrocellulose, capable of causing violent explosions. We thus note that plasticity is
                  situated between two extremes: “on the one side the sensible image of taking form (sculpture or plastic objects), and on the other side that of the annihilation of all form (explosion).”<sup><a href="#fn:31"
                      rel="footnote"></a></sup></blockquote>
                <div class="text-indent">
                  <p>This duality thus implies from one side, normative standards impose distinct castings for us to mold into, but from the other, it might be the very agent in deforming, refusing to take any cast at all. As much as I am very drawn
                    to unfold the possibilities in the latter, I am to argue in the following how neuroplasticity is framed to support neoliberal economic goals. The first aspect that needs addressing is how the discourse on neuroplasticity
                    established the brain to be conceived as this highly flexible and adaptable organ. Based on her content analysis, of 250 print media accounts, Victoria Pitts-Taylor claims the brain’s capacity is often articulated as highly
                    underutilized and its potential presented untapped.<sup><a href="#fn:32" rel="footnote"></a></sup> It is strongly advocated to become fully aware of this condition and initiate the adoption of certain practices, that are believed
                    to enhance cerebral connections. </p>
                  <div class="text-indent">
                    <p>Neoliberalism operates in a highly comparable model, as social theorist Pierre Bourdieu calls it “the absolute reign of flexibility”.<sup><a href="#fn:33" rel="footnote"></a></sup> Subjects of the neoliberal economy are driven
                      to be ever more flexible and adaptive to keep up with the continuous precarization of working conditions. In order for neoliberalism to thrive, its economic processes require perpetual growth, which today is mainly achieved
                      through the engineering, modulating, and harvesting of value from the vital capacities of its subjects. To avoid atrophy, economic engines must move forward, just as the brain requires master tasks, to keep neuronal pathways
                      strong and interconnected. As a contemporary technology of the self, brain plasticity is shifting a significant amount of responsibility on the individual to self-regulate, and take risk-avoiding preventive measures. The very
                      problem at stake nonetheless is, that the (unsustainable) socio-economic regime of neoliberalism is the leading factor in the spiking rise of psychopathologies.

                      black market, is a structural element of the psychopathogenic economy.<sup><a href="#fn:34" rel="footnote"></a></sup></blockquote>

                      <p>The last aspect left undiscovered is delving into how neuropolitics operates via chemical control being imposed on the neoliberal subject, therefore, becoming the new normal. On March 26, 1990, Newsweek presented ‘A
                        Breakthrough Drug for Depression’ on their cover, featuring a blown-up illustration of a pill, that by today sounds all too familiar to everyone: Prozac. The green-and-white pill containing 20 mg of fluoxetine hydrochloride
                        claimed to be a game-changer in treating melancholia and fundamentally changed how society regards the ‘dysfunction’ of the brain in the 21st century. </p>
                      <div class="text-indent">
                        <p>SSRIs, standing for serotonin reuptake inhibitors entered the public knowledge to be a highly efficient new compound, as they would precisely target the neurochemical anomaly on the cellular level: the low serotonin levels
                          found in the synapses. Drug advertising and a vast amount of publications praised Prozac and its doppelgängers, like Zoloft and Lexapro to be some wonder-drug, that would lift the unbearable weariness and paralysis from
                          one’s shoulder, and help re-vitalizing the individual, while also inherently contributing to how clinical depression is framed as a one-dimensional dysfunction of a monoamine transmitter.
                          Despite the fact, that the very functioning of the SSRI’s has been brought into question not long after their initial introduction to the market, and the scientific community regards their working mechanism solely based on a
                          hypothesis, the number of dispensed antidepressant medicine users in the Netherlands amounted to nearly 1.04 million in 2020.<sup><a href="#fn:35" rel="footnote"></a></sup>
                        </p>
                        <div class="text-indent">
                          <p>What does it mean for modern society, that even though SSRIs are proven to be as ineffective as given placebos for the majority of those taking them, while often causing negative side effects and withdrawal symptoms,
                            prescription, therefore consumption rates still continue to increase?
                            It is inarguably evident, the accelerated use of psychopharmaceuticals is driven by the key values neoliberal political economy aims to serve. As neoliberalism eradicated the security of social welfare, and significantly
                            reduced the role of non-market institutions, like trade unions, while pervasively promoting individualism and defining all human relations in terms of competition, the individual turns to the most evident solution, that
                            requires a minimal amount of invested time and effort solving their problem. </p>

                                ADHD, it is rising popular among those without the disorder to stimulate cognitive performance. According to DEA Diversion Control report, the primary abusers are individuals younger than 25 years of age; who often
